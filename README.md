This repository contains source code for the Generative Design module which I had worked on as part of my 2nd year internship project at Palpx Technologies, Bangalore. It includes many different ways to generate variety of designs. From simple mathematical designs like customised fractals and spirals to abstract designs generated using deep neural networks to Generative Networks, the module is rich with many different ways of generating customised designs.
